# CTF Overview
**What is a CTF?**

Capture the Flag is a type of educational challenge used to solve a variety of tasks, testing the technical and strategical skills of its participants. “Flags” are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. Competitors can steal flags (attack/defence style) or find hidden flags (jeopardy-style challenge).
